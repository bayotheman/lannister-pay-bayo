Technical assessment task administered by flutterwave 

Note: This task was carried out with Springboot(java), because I have no experience with Nodejs and the allotted time for the task isn't sufficient enough to learn Nodejs. I apologize to the flutterwave team for submitting this task late because, I saw the assessment task mail late, which is totally my fault.
I hope you(flutterwave team) accept this submission out of kindness. But even if it doesn't get accepted, I want to thank for you for the challenge, because it was fun to work on.
